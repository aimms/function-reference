.. _CaseDialogConfirmAndSave:

CaseDialogConfirmAndSave
========================

The procedure :aimms:func:`CaseDialogConfirmAndSave` shows and handles the
standard confirmation dialog box, in which the user is asked whether he
wants to save the currently active data before continuing.

.. code-block:: aimms

   CaseDialogConfirmAndSave

Return Value
------------

   The procedure returns 1 if the user chooses not to save the data, or if
   the user chooses to save the data and the save was executed
   successfully. It returns 0 if the user cancelled any of the dialog
   boxes. If any other error occurs, the procedure returns :math:`-1` and
   ``CurrentErrorMessage`` will contain a proper error message.

   .. note::

      -  This procedure is only applicable if the project option
         ``Data_Management_style`` is set to ``Disk_files_and_folders``.

      -  This procedure returns 0 if the IDE is not loaded, for example when
         running the component version of AIMMS, or when running with the
         command line option ``--as-server``.

      -  This procedure does not check whether the data needs to be saved;
         that check should be made by the calling code, prior to calling this
         procedure.

      -  If the user confirms to save the data, the function
         ``CaseDialogSave`` is called. If no active case file exists, this
         implies that the ``CaseDialogSaveAs`` is called instead.
