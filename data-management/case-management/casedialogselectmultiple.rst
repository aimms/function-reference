.. _CaseDialogSelectMultiple:

CaseDialogSelectMultiple
========================

The procedure :aimms:func:`CaseDialogSelectMultiple` shows a case file selection
dialog box in which you can select multiple case files. The result is a
subset of :aimms:set:`AllCases` that can be used in multiple case views, or in
execution statements with the case dot notation.

.. code-block:: aimms

    CaseDialogSelectMultiple(
        selectedCaseFiles     ! (input/output) a subset of AllCases
        )

Arguments
---------

    *selectedCaseFiles*
        A subset of :aimms:set:`AllCases`. On entry, this subset is used to initalize the
        selection in the dialog box. On return, it contains the subset that has
        been selected by the user.

Return Value
------------

    The procedure returns 1 if the user selected a set of case files, and 0
    if the user cancelled the dialog box.

    .. note::

        -   This function is only applicable if the project option
            ``Data_Management_style`` is set to ``Disk_files_and_folders``.

        -   This function returns 0 if the IDE is not loaded, for example when
            running the component version of AIMMS, or when running with the
            command line option ``--as-server``.

        -   You can use any subset of :aimms:set:`AllCases` as an argument to this
            function, but if you want to use it for a multiple case view in one
            of your pages, you should use the predefined set :aimms:set:`CurrentCaseSelection`.

        -   If the subset should have the selected cases in the order as
            specified in the dialog, you must make sure that the given subset has
            the attribute ``Order by`` set to ``user``.
